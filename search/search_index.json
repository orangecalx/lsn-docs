It's influenced by no-input mixing techniques and the use of feedback paths by groups such as Yellow Swans. Functioning similarly to feedback loop devices found in the effects pedal world, LSN differentiates itself by being voltage-controlled. CV given to LSN controls a vactrol placed in the middle of the feedback loop, letting more or less signal through. LSN works best with delays, filters, and other modules that process and incoming signal, but as always experimentation is encouraged. SPECIFICATIONS 6HP wide Skiff-friendly 30ma draw on +12v rail, 30ma draw on -12v rail 100kOhm / 1kOhm Input/Output impedence, respectively Vactrol control of feedback amount FUNCTIONS FEEDBACK (center knob) Amount of signal allowed through the feedback path, and thus the amount of feedback. GAIN The...gain...of the feedback loop preamp. RETURN Output of feedback path. connect to the OUTPUT of the donor module (the module you want to have feedback) SEND Input of feedback path. connect to the INPUT of the donor module. CV Control voltage input for FEEDBACK control. vactrol-based, nonlinear, you know the drill. When CV is injected, the FEEDBACK knob acts as an offset. OUT Main output of the module. TIPS / TRICKS Types of modules that work best with LSN: filters, distortions, reverbs and delays especially! all modules will have different input impedences and circuit designs. experiment! we keep telling you to experiment please god A secret: LSN's feedback loop is basically an LPG sans the \"L\". by patching a sound source into \"RETURN\", listening to the output on \"SEND\", and using the CV input, you can use it as a very dirty vactrol. note that due to the boost circuit the signal will always be at least slightly distorted, but this is good.

This covers manufacturing + assembly issues. Incorrect power connections (power supplies with wrong polarity, too much power, etc), wear and tear from normal use, and issues due to modifications are not covered by said Warranty (although you should absolutely email us with any mods you do). We will repair, replace, or refund depending on the circumstances. Shipping will be paid by the buyer.
